# DS-Project
Zomato data with Python to derive insights on restaurant trends, user preferences, and geographical patterns
Python and its following libraries are used to analyze Zomato data.

#1)Numpy– With Numpy arrays, complex computations are executed quickly, and large calculations are handled efficiently.
#2)Matplotlib– It has a wide range of features for creating high-quality plots, charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more.
#3)Pandas– The library simplifies the loading of data frames into 2D arrays and provides functions for performing multiple analysis tasks in a single operation.
#4)Seaborn– It offers a high-level interface for creating visually appealing and informative statistical graphics. 
#You can use Google Colab Notebook or Jupyter Notebook to simplify your task.

#To address our analysis, we need to respond to the subsequent inquiries:

#Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?
#Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?
#What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?

#CONCLUSION: Dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders, whereas cafes primarily receive online orders. This suggests that clients prefer to place orders in person at restaurants, but prefer online ordering at cafes.
